This first repository I make on GitHub

Hi Humans!

Twisted here, I like League (as you can tell) and other games.
I would like to start coding to maybe code a hit game (or something else that would make me rich, after I find games not interesting anymore probably). I am a noob so sorry for any dumb mistakes I make and help from anyone is well appreciated. Thanks.
